##Entry 2:
From last entry I wanted to make a commit to a project with machine learning. My goal has slightly changed from then, with more of a focus on learning how to use TensorFlow and train a model with it. From then I have finalised a project to work on a which is a website that uses machine learning to classify celestial bodies. To contribute to it, I looked through the issues and found one which I thought I could resolve. This was to train the model to classify natural satellites (aka moons of planets).

I got to work trying to resolve this issue by first getting all the training data. This consisted of going on Google and downloading pictures of the sattellites which I wanted to train the model on. I then needed to look into the machine learning framework used - TensorFlow. I initially had some problems trying to run the program, because of an error to do with the validation set not being enough for Uranus. I did some research and learned about how TensorFlow has a training set, a testing set and a validation set. A validation set is taken out of the test set to see how the model is doing during training, and whether it is going in the right direction. To counteract the error, I added more images to the testing set of Uranus.

After doing this I started getting the model to become trained on Phobos; one of Mars' moons. By looking at the folders with the images I learned that there were many more training images compared to testing. From further researching this I learned that it is standard practise to have something like a 70:30 split from training to testing images.

After adding a similar ratio of pictures of Phobos to the relevant folders I started to train the model. The accuracy was 84%, which I thought was quite good. I then ran the webapp version and used it to manaully have a go testing an image of Phobos. Before this worked, however, I had to alter some code that scraped the information from wikiepdia, as scraping from Phobos wikipedia entry was slightly different to the other planets.:

You can see in the image above, the confidence of the model. It only has a confidence of 0.52 for Phobos which is not very high. One of my next steps is to get the model more confident in identifying it. Additionally, I would like to introduce more sattellites so that I can submit a pull request for the issue and move onto something else.
