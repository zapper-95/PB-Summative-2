## Entry 4:
In my previous entry I submitted a pull request for the project. Since then, I have recieved some requested changes https://github.com/ritwik12/Celestial-bodies-detection/pull/85. 

Firstly I removed some directories which I should not have included in the pull request. Then I updated the display info so that a table displayed certain information about the satellites.

Now all I needed to do was update the README file, which documented what the project was doing.

I struggled to understand how the pictures in it had been referenced, as I had previosuly referenced images in the actuall GitHub repo whereas it didn't. However, I learned that if you go to report an issue and drop and drag an image, GitHub uploads it and creates a link.

Finally, I pushed all these changes to my forked version and have left a comment under my pull request to get my changes reviewed again.

I think I have fulfilled my original goal of contributing to a project which was using neural networks and machine learning. I have learnt a lot about how neural networks work, through my background research, and through working on a project, learned how to implement them. I have also learnt about how to collobarte on Github through finding issues, submitting pull requests, and working on feedback from that request.
