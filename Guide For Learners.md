# Guide For Learners

## Motivation
Machine learning has become an increasingly relevant topic for computer scientists. It has allowed us to solve problems which were once before infeasible. For example, solving language processing or image classification tasks using traditional methods is very difficult. To do this, you would have to manually program the different patterns that the computer should pick up on. Labelling the data and allowing the computer to find these patterns itself is a much better solution. 

Not only is machine learning helpful for computer scientists, but it could improve the lives of everyone. For example, machine learning has been used in disease diagnosis and the model used in this study was found to perform better than 75% of the doctors on the same task:

Apart from social good, machine learning has much economic importance. Take the U.S postal service. Beforehand, post had to be manually checked for information such as the ZIP code. With a digit recognition model in place, the USPS could process post a lot quicker, and at lower costs - in their first year they saved one hundred million dollars through this:

How should this information apply to you? Well, it should at the very least, be encouragement to understand the basics of machine learning and how it works. The examples I have provided, give evidence that using it could be fruitful for your own endeavours through drastically saving costs or increasing performance. By learning how to use some of the frameworks out there, such as TensorFlow, you can learn how to quickly and easily build very powerful models. 

## Background and Learning Materials
My target audience is someone who has a basic to intermediate understanding of programming and mathematics. 

In terms of programming, knowing how to use Python or Java would be helpful, as these are the two languages you can use TensorFlow with. If you know Python, I would recommend first learning about how to use Keras. Keras is another machine learning library, but it works on top of TensorFlow. I found it easier to understand and so it might help ease you into machine learning better. I would recommend this specific tutorial:

I found it has some good explanations and helps walk you through building a program to recognise handwritten digits. I specifically followed this tutorial, because it can be used in conjunction with the video series by 3Blue1Brown on Neural Networks, where he uses the specific example of recognising handwritten digits:

For the mathematics side, knowing how to perform basic operations on matrices, such as addition or multiplication would be good. Knowledge of calculus will be useful for understanding how the different algorithms optimize the model. I would therefore recommend 3Blue1Browns series on the essence of calculus to get some intuition for this:

The series is very good for building the correct intuitions about different concepts in calculus. In machine learning you can think of training the model as minimising a certain cost function, which evaluates how bad its performance is.  

All, this being said, most of the technical detail is hidden by TensorFlow, so you could alternatively just get started, and treat the
