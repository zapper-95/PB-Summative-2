# Guide For Learners
 
## Motivation
Machine learning has become an increasingly relevant topic for computer scientists. It has allowed us to solve problems which were once before infeasible. For example, solving language processing or image classification tasks using traditional methods is very difficult. To do this, you would have to manually program the different patterns that the computer should pick up on. Labelling the data and allowing the computer to find these patterns itself is a much better solution. 
 
Not only is machine learning helpful for computer scientists, but it could improve the lives of everyone. For example, machine learning has been used in disease diagnosis and the model used in this study was found to perform better than 75% of the doctors on the same task:

Apart from social good, machine learning has much economic importance. Take the U.S postal service. Beforehand, the post had to be manually checked for information such as the ZIP code. With a digit recognition model in place, the USPS could process post a lot quicker, and at lower costs - in their first year they saved one hundred million dollars through this:

How should this information apply to you? Well, it should at the very least, be an encouragement to understand the basics of machine learning. The examples I have provided, give evidence that using it could be fruitful for your own endeavours through drastically saving costs or increasing performance. By learning how to use some of the frameworks out there, such as TensorFlow, you can learn how to quickly and easily build very powerful models. 
 
## Background and Learning Materials
My target audience is someone who has a basic to intermediate understanding of programming and mathematics. 
 
In terms of programming, knowing how to use Python or JavaScript would be helpful, as these are the two languages you can use TensorFlow with. If you know Python, I recommend first learning about how to use Keras. Keras is another machine learning library, but it works on top of TensorFlow. I found it easier to understand and so it might help ease you into machine learning better. I would recommend this specific tutorial:

I found it has some good explanations which it walks you through at a good pace. At the end of it, you will have built a program to recognise handwritten digits. I specifically chose this tutorial, because it can be used in conjunction with the video series by 3Blue1Brown on Neural Networks:

In it, he uses the specific example of recognising handwritten digits to help explain how neural networks work. This I believe will allow you to understand what you have implemented, at least at a high level. Unless you are familiar with calculus, there is some parts in the last video that discuss partial differentiation. If you don’t understand them, I would skip those parts until you can.
 
If you haven’t already, I would recommend learning some basic mathematics like operations on matrices, such as matrix addition and multiplication. Additionally, knowledge of calculus is important for machine learning in order to understand the different ways of optimising your model. I would therefore recommend 3Blue1Browns series on the essence of calculus to get some intuition for this:

This series is very good for building the correct intuitions about different concepts in calculus. The videos have a strong visual focus so you can relate what you are seeing on the screen with the concept. For example, in Chapter 4 the explanation of the chain rule by using areas of rectangles helped the concept make more sense to me.

In terms of learning TensorFlow, I found a mixture of Stack Overflow and the TensorFlow website useful. In the GitHub project I worked on, the code was already there, so for me it was more just tweaking parts so that the model could be retrained on my computer.
 
## Evaluation
I would say that learning TensorFlow and machine learning is a very useful skill in the modern age. If you run your own business and need to make some sort of decision-based on lots and lots of data, machine learning will only serve you well to make this. Moreover, if you have an e-commerce site and you want to better suggest products to the user, a machine learning recommendation system could do this. There are so many ways in which knowing how to implement it could help you.
 
That being said, not everyone has the time to invest to learn it. There is quite a demand, especially if you do not know how to program or have the relevant mathematical knowledge. Whether it is worth the effort to learn it or not I would say depends upon two things: How useful would it be to you, and how much effort would you have to put in to learn it. Even if you do not have the relevant mathematics yet, I still would suggest learning how to use TensorFlow, because of my reasons stated before. Treating it as more of a black box does mean, however, it is more difficult to fix when things go wrong, but most likely you will get a model that does a task better than a human could or for less cost. 
 
As discussed above, if you are using Python, a similar alternative would be to use Keras or Scikit-Learn. These are both higher level and would make it easier to get used to working with machine learning frameworks.
